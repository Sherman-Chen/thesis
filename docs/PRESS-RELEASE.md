There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
Online Coding Challenge battleground featuring multiple testing sequences, powerups, and spectator viewing!

## Sub-Heading ##
For coders worldwide to engage in friendly or competitive challeneges against each other, or just brush up with some solo challenges! Live viewing is also available, watch top coders battle each other, or spend some time watching friends code off!

## Summary ##
What makes coding fun is solving challenges. Prove your skills against others in live competition, with the twist of powerups to make things really exciting! Passing your tests and crushing the opponent? Why not freeze their code to prove your dominance! Need a pick up or helpful hint? Peek at the others code or even turn the opponents speed against him when all his insertions become deletions!

## Problem ##
Solving challenges is fun, but doing it alone can get boring or dull a sense of urgency. Doing things alone is often times

## Solution ##
CodeOff resolves this by introducing live competition to really spark the feeling of accomplishment when you win! Show off your skills against your friends and others, fire off powerups against the competiton, and become the top hacker in the world. 

## Quote from You ##
"There is no better feeling than crushing the competition while simultaneously freezing or blacking out their code" -Robbie Gifford (Hacker Master)

## How to Get Started ##
From the homepage just select "play now", and then select your mode of choice (solo, or battle)!

## Customer Quote ##
"I got blacked out and frozen so hard I ragequit immediately, 0/5 stars...would play again" -Sherman Chen (Sore Loser)

## Closing and Call to Action ##
If you've gotten this far you have read too much, instead go try out the excitement for yourself!
